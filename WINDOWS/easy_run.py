"""Blox Fruits auto-fisher — double-click launcher with a GUI.

Same bot as `run.py`, without the terminal. Aimed at people who just want to
double-click a file:

  * installs `requirements.txt` on first run (once per machine, tracked by a
    marker file next to the config);
  * asks the setup questions as an illustrated form, one card per question;
  * shows the pre-flight checklist, with pictures for the two steps people get
    wrong most (standing in range, and equipping the rod);
  * runs the engine with a live log, F2 to start/stop.

Drop your own screenshots into `assets/gui/` to illustrate the cards — see
`IMAGES` below for the filenames. Anything missing is simply skipped, so the
app works with no images at all.
