"""Buying bait from a fishing NPC.

Mapped frame-by-frame from a screen recording (two full purchase cycles,
x10 then x20). Everything below is measured, not guessed.

## Path F — Fisherman

The dialogue is a stack of right-aligned buttons. The useful accident is that
**the option we want is always the first one**, at the same screen position
three times in a row:

    click centre      -> "Interact"  -> dialogue opens
    click menu item 1 -> "Shop"
    click menu item 1 -> "Buy Bait"
    click menu item 1 -> "Basic Bait"   -> CRAFT window opens

The CRAFT window starts at **10** bait for 1000 Money. Each `+` click adds
another **10** (verified: 10 -> 20 took the cost 1000 -> 2000), so buying N bait
is `N/10 - 1` clicks on `+` followed by `Craft`.

Crafting drops you back on the bait menu, and the way out is two more clicks —
both on the **last** menu entry, which lands at the same spot for both:

    click menu last -> "Back"       -> main menu
    click menu last -> "Nevermind"  -> dialogue closes

Closing the dialogue leaves shift lock **off** (the cursor is free again), so
the last step is to press Left Shift to re-engage it and tap `W` to step back
into fishing position.

Observed click positions (logical desktop px at 1920x1080, game window
1920x1032) and what they become as fractions of the window:

    centre / Interact   (960, 527)   -> (0.5000, 0.5107)
    menu item 1         (1415, 513)  -> (0.7370, 0.4971)
    craft  +            (1217, 541)  -> (0.6339, 0.5242)
    craft  Craft        (987, 666)   -> (0.5141, 0.6453)
    menu last           (1346, 675)  -> (0.7010, 0.6541)
